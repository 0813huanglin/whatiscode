# bot api

### **bot()** returns a bot

### **bot()()** initializes

### bot.**botName**(*string*)

Getter/setter for #id, for multiple bots on one page.

### bot.**jumpTo**(*[x,y] or selection*)

Teleport to coordinates.

### bot.goTo([x,y] or selection)

Smoothly go to.

### bot.**show()**  
### bot.**hide()**  

Shows/hides in place. Could have some randomized entrance/exit animation.

### bot.**pulse()**

Desperate for attention, just does some "hey look at me" animation.

### bot.**click**(*selection*)

Fires a click event on the designated target

### bot.**speak**(*string, [callback]*)

Animates typey-typing string. Callback when finished.

### bot.**eval**(*string, [callback]*)

Animates typey-typing string, and then `eval()`s string. Callback when finished.

### bot.**emote**(*string*)

Switches bot face to given emotion, currently either "default", "pray", or "amiga"

### bot.**responses**(*array*)

Sets button prompts; a 'script' for the bot to follow is bound to every button. That script can in turn have more branching responses. So it's a nested tree.

### bot.**script**(*object*)

Sets a 'script' (like for an actor) for the bot to follow. A script consists of a set of actions (speak, eval, do, emote[TK]), and branches for the user to follow. Every branch is just another script.

### bot.**destroy**()

Destroys the bot in grand fashion. Currently just hides. ;)

# "Script" syntax

We need a better term than "script" because that just sounds like a generic javascript script. Anyway, you can pass the bot an object that defines actions for it to follow. This is **NOT JSON** â€” it's a JS object, and thus can contain real functions. It looks like this:

```javascript
var botScript =
{
  "prompt": null,
  "speak": "Hi, I'm Paulbot. Welcome to my Learninal! We will have fun today.",
  "do": null,
  "eval": null,
  "responses": [
    {
      "prompt": "Button Label 1",
      "speak": "Great! Hover over the black bar at the bottom and start coding.",
      "do": function() { paulbot.goTo(d3.select("strong")); },
      "responses": [ ... ]
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
